# Flappy-bird-game
Gesture Control A fun twist on Flappy Bird built using Processing and controlled via ESP32/ESP8266 with an ultrasonic sensor. The player flaps using hand gestures instead of keys, with real-time serial communication between ESP and Processing. A buzzer gives audio cues for game start, obstacle clear, and game over, adding a more immersive feel.


# 🕹️ Gesture-Controlled Flappy Bird Game using ESP and Processing

A fun, interactive twist on the classic Flappy Bird game — controlled not with keys, but with your **hand gestures**! This project uses an **ESP32/ESP8266** microcontroller and an **ultrasonic sensor** to detect motion and control gameplay, while the visuals and logic are handled using **Processing**.

## 🚀 Features

- 🖐️ **Gesture-based Control** — Flap the bird using your hand movements via the ultrasonic sensor.
- 🔊 **Buzzer Feedback** — Audio feedback on game start, obstacle cleared, and game over.
- 🎮 **Processing-powered Graphics** — Smooth and responsive Flappy Bird visuals using Processing.
- 🔄 **Real-time Serial Communication** — ESP sends sensor data to Processing over serial.

🧠 How It Works
ESP Setup: Measures hand distance using the ultrasonic sensor.

Serial Communication: Sends this distance data to the Processing sketch.

Game Mechanics: Processing receives data and makes the bird jump based on threshold changes.

Sound Effects: A buzzer on the ESP provides sound cues for different game events.

🔧 Installation & Usage
1. Upload Arduino Code
Connect ESP to PC.

Open esp_flappy.ino in Arduino IDE.

Select correct board and port.

Upload.

2. Run Processing Game
Open flappy_bird.pde in Processing IDE.

Make sure the serial port matches your ESP's COM port.

Run the sketch and play using hand gestures!
