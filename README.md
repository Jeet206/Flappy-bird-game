# Flappy-bird-game
Gesture Control A fun twist on Flappy Bird built using Processing and controlled via ESP32/ESP8266 with an ultrasonic sensor. The player flaps using hand gestures instead of keys, with real-time serial communication between ESP and Processing. A buzzer gives audio cues for game start, obstacle clear, and game over, adding a more immersive feel.
